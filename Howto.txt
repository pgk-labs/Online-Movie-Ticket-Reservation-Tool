Instructions for Setting Up the Project

Install the software from Apache (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

After installation, start the Apache and MySQL services.

Copy the necessary files to the XAMPP directory as below:

Place the ticket_reservation folder in the xampp/mysql/data directory.

Place the ib_logfile0, ib_logfile1, and ibdata1 files in the xampp/mysql/data directory.

Use the TICKETS.sql file to import the database via phpMyAdmin.


Finally, import the project into NetBeans.


Make sure you import also the mysql-connector into the project directory. If not, the error "Cannot connect to database" will come up continiously.
